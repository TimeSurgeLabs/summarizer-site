# Discord Bot

## Bot Usage

Have the bot join your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1091719758132547625&scope=bot&permissions=83968) and give it access to all the channels you want it to watch. By default it will join all public channels and watch them, but you can also give it access to private channels by inviting it to them via Discord Roles.

Once the bot is in your server, you can use it by sending it a message that contains a YouTube link. The bot will then summarize the video for you and send back a reply with a brief summary of the video content.

## Features

This bot has the following features:

* Ability to summarize YouTube videos.
* Always summarizes the first video in a message.
* Extracts links from messages that contain other text.
* Response with a brief summary of the video content.

## Development

The bot was developed with [Nextcord](https://nextcord.dev).
