# Telegram Bot

## Bot Usage

To use the bot, you need to send it a message that contains a YouTube link. The bot will then summarize the video for you and send back a reply with a brief summary of the video content. 

Please note that in order for the bot to work properly, it needs to be added as an admin in a group chat. To add the bot to a group chat, simply search for [@YTSummarizeBot](https://t.me/YTSummarizeBot) in the Telegram search bar and select it. Then, click the "Add to Group" button and select the group chat you want to add the bot to. Once the bot has been added to the group, you will need to make it an admin so that it can function properly.
